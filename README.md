# Drone-No-Auto
 This code is for the custom drone that I am making. It will not feature most automation
 that may be added in the future. The board being used is en elegoo r3. This code will not
 offer any fpv either due to wanting to use a different board.

 Bill of materials: (still looking at exact parts that will be used)

 x4 brushless motors
 x4 motor controllers
 x1 drone frame
 x1 radio transmiter/receiver
 x2 lipo battery
 x4 leds
